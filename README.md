# mac-setup

The tools and customizations I put on a Mac myself, with one script that
installs them all. IT-managed software stays out.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/oleg-chibikov/mac-setup.git
./mac-setup/install.sh
```

The script is idempotent: run it again and it skips what is already there.

## Homebrew

Source: [brew.sh](https://brew.sh). The script installs Homebrew itself when
missing.

| Formula | Why |
| --- | --- |
| [git](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git) | newer than the Apple one |
| [gh](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gh) | GitHub CLI |
| [mise](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mise) | node, pnpm and yarn versions per project |
| [fzf](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/fzf) | the branch picker in `git sb` |
| [jq](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq) | git-aliases and gh-review-notify parse JSON with it |
| [shellcheck](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/shellcheck) | `lint.sh` in git-aliases runs it |
| [shfmt](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/shfmt) | same `lint.sh` formats with it |
| [terminal-notifier](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/terminal-notifier) | gh-review-notify pops macOS notifications through it |
| [mkcert](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mkcert) | local HTTPS certificates |
| [agent-browser](https://agent-browser.dev/) | browser automation for coding agents |

| Cask | Why |
| --- | --- |
| [visual-studio-code](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/visual-studio-code) | editor |
| [docker-desktop](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/docker-desktop) | containers |
| [maccy](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/maccy) | clipboard history |
| [claude](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/claude) | Claude desktop app |
| [android-platform-tools](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/android-platform-tools) | adb for mobile testing |

## Node toolchain

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) pins the versions globally:

```sh
mise use -g node@22 pnpm@latest yarn@1
```

On top, one npm global:
[`@github/copilot`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/copilot), the Copilot
CLI.

## Git

Global config the script sets:

```sh
git config --global color.ui true
git config --global push.autosetupremote true
```

`user.name` and `user.email` are prompted on first run, so the script carries
no personal data.

Aliases come from
[oleg-chibikov/git-aliases](https://github.com/oleg-chibikov/git-aliases). Its
own `install.sh` wires the `include.path` and offers to source `git-sb.zsh`.
That wrapper is separate from the aliases on purpose: `git sb` can land on a
branch in another worktree, and only a shell function can `cd` the parent
shell there.

## Shell

- **Oh My Zsh** from [ohmyz.sh](https://ohmyz.sh), default `robbyrussell`
  theme, `git` plugin.
- **`~/.local/bin` on PATH** for the self-written CLIs.
- **`mise activate zsh`** in `.zshrc`.

## My repos

Cloned into `~/Documents/Dev`, each installed by its own `install.sh`:

| Repo | What it gives |
| --- | --- |
| [git-aliases](https://github.com/oleg-chibikov/git-aliases) | short git commands: `git sb`, `git db`, `git m` and the rest |
| [agent-skills](https://github.com/oleg-chibikov/agent-skills) | Copilot skills: writing-style, review, create-pr, implement-ticket, address-comments |
| [gh-review-notify](https://github.com/oleg-chibikov/gh-review-notify) | macOS notification for every new PR review comment, runs as a LaunchAgent |

## GitHub CLI

```sh
gh auth login
gh extension install github/gh-stack
```

[gh-stack](https://github.com/github/gh-stack) manages stacked PRs.

## Teamwork Graph CLI

`twg` reads and writes Jira and Confluence from the terminal and from agents.
Source: [teamwork-graph.atlassian.com](https://teamwork-graph.atlassian.com).

```sh
bash <(curl -fsSL https://teamwork-graph.atlassian.com/cli/install)
```

The installer puts `twg` in `~/.local/bin`, asks you to accept Atlassian's
terms and log in. It also adds the `com.atlassian.twg.upkeep` LaunchAgent,
which runs `twg upkeep` every 12 minutes to keep the CLI updated. Skip npm: the
package there is too old to run.

## MCP servers

The script copies [mcp-config.json](./mcp-config.json) to
`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` when the file is missing. It wires the Atlassian
and GitHub MCP servers.

## Claude Code memory

[claude/MEMORY.md](./claude/MEMORY.md) holds notes Claude Code reads in every
project:

- **pnpm version** comes from `packageManager`, pinned per repo through mise.
- **`GH_PAGER=cat`** keeps `gh` from opening a pager and hanging the agent.
- **Review asks** load the `review` skill from agent-skills first.

The script copies the file to `~/.claude/MEMORY.md` when missing and imports
it at the top of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. The writing-style import in the same
file comes from the agent-skills installer.

## Not scripted

- **Secrets** go into 1Password, no dotfile keeps them.
